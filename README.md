Data Selection and Applications

The dataset was selected based on its relevance and suitability for the task of object detection
involving common animals such as dogs, cats, and monkeys. I chose the Torch Vision Object
Detection fine-tuning tutorial[1] and sourced this small dataset from Kaggle[2]. It contains images
of three different animal species, providing a good variety for training an object detection model.
The dataset includes hand-annotated images with annotations available in XML and CSV
formats. With 469 images in the training set and 51 images in the test set, it is large enough to
fine-tune a model but small enough to manage with available computational resources.
The dataset can be used as a starting point for learning about training object detection using
transfer learning.
